# The Thurmes Cookbook

This book is made of passed-down family recipes, recipes we have found and thought were good, and the like.

To compile, you at least need the [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) pdflatex compiler. The compilation commands I use involve the -aux-directory option which is MiKTeX-specific. If you want to use a different compiler, you will need to fork this repository then alter the compilation commands in the makefile and Cookbook.tex.

For an IDE to make changes or add new content, I suggest Texstudio. It is multiplatform and interprets the compilation command in Cookbook.tex correctly.
