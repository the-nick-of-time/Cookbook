\begin{recipe}[BakedPotato]{\textbf{Baked Potatoes}}{4 servings}{20 minutes baking}

  \Ingredient{4 smallish potatoes (100-200 grams)}
  Wash, scrub, and poke some holes in the potatoes.
  Microwave for 8 minutes on high. Heat the oven to 350\0F.
  Put the potatoes directly on the oven rack and bake until sufficiently tender, at least 10 minutes. It's pretty hard to overcook them, so I usually bake until the skins are dry and pulled away from the innards and they are forkable, then turn the oven off and leave them in there until it's time to eat.
