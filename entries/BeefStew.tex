\begin{recipe}{Beef Stew}{6 servings}{60 minutes}

Heat a 5-quart pot/dutch oven with oil covering the bottom.

\Ingredient{2 lb beef cut into 2-cm cubes}
\Ingredient{4 tablespoons flour}
\Ingredient{2 teaspoons sage}
\Ingredient{1 teaspoon thyme}
Mix flour and spices together. Roll beef in the flour to get fully coated. When done, add meat to the pot and start it browning. Add any leftover flour at any point there is enough liquid to support it.

\Ingredient{2 celery stalks, diced}
\Ingredient{2 medium onions, diced}
Once meat is brown, add the base vegetables. Cook together until most of the liquid has simmered away.

\Ingredient{2 cups beef stock}
Add beef stock to make up the difference (this is a good time for the excess flour). Bring it up to a simmer again.

\Ingredient{Several potatoes, cubed}
\Ingredient{Carrots, in chunks}
\Ingredient{1 bay leaf}
Add the vegetables and cover. Cook until they are done.
