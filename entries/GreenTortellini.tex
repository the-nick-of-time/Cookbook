\begin{recipe}{Green Tortellini}{6 servings}{20 minutes}

	\Ingredient{1 ounce basil pesto (see page \pageref{Pesto})}
	Take the pesto out of its package and microwave in a large bowl until fully melted and hot.

	\Ingredient{\fr34 cup Parmesan/Romano cheese}
	Mix the cheese into the pesto and stir to combine. Ideally the cheese partially melts into the pesto and blends in well.

	\Ingredient{1 pound tortellini}
	Boil water. When it is at a rolling boil, pour in the tortellini. Cook for 6 minutes (starting from frozen) or until soft.

	Strain the tortellini and add it to the pesto. Make sure that the tortellini is very wet; adding a tablespoon or two of the water in which the tortellini was cooked to the final system can be helpful.
	Stir everything together and serve.
	Serving at room temperature is recommended by the Italians but that is heresy.
