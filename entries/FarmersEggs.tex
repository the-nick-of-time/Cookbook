\begin{recipe}{Farmer's Eggs}{2 servings}{30 minutes}

\Ingredient{2 medium potatoes}
\Ingredient{Salt}
\Ingredient{3 tablespoons butter}
Cook on low in a covered pan until soft. The potatoes shouldn't be brown yet at this stage.

\Ingredient{1 medium onion, chopped}
\Ingredient{2 ounces thick cut ham, cut bite sized}
Add to the pan and cook until onions are translucent and meat is lightly browned.

\Ingredient{3 eggs}
\Ingredient{3 tablespoons milk}
Beat the eggs and milk together to be mostly homogeneous. 
Add to the pan and mix with everything.

\Ingredient{\fr12 cup shredded cheese}
After about a minute, add the cheese. 
That'll give it enough time to melt in by the time the eggs are finished.
