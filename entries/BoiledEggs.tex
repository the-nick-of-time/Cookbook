		Boil enough water to submerge the eggs.
		Add the eggs and boil them for an amount of time given by the table.
		% This presumes the eggs are starting from the fridge, room temperature subtracts about 40 seconds.
		``Soft'' is what you want to add to ramen, it's got the thickened but not yet cooked yolk that is important there.
		Transfer the eggs to the ice water for about 2 minutes. This makes them easier to peel and stops them from cooking more.
