	% https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/daphne-brogdon/coconut-rice-pudding-with-mango-2828593
	\Ingredient{\fr34 cup jasmine rice}
	Cook as usual.

	\Ingredient{14 oz coconut milk}
	\Ingredient{\fr12 cup sugar}
	\Ingredient{\fr12 teaspoon vanilla extract}
	\Ingredient{\fr14 teaspoon salt}
	\Ingredient{Zest of \fr14 orange}
	In a large saucepan over low heat, combine and cook until the mixture is hot and the sugar is dissolved. Do not let the mixture boil as the coconut milk could curdle.
	Stir in the cooked rice, cover, and cook on low until thick and the rice has absorbed most of the coconut milk, about 15--20 minutes.
	If the rice is not fresh (prepared ahead of time and refrigerated) it takes much longer to cook, more like 60--80 minutes.

	\Ingredient{1 mango, diced}
	\Ingredient{Fresh mint leaves}
	Top the pudding before serving.
