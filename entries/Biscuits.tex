Preheat the oven to \tempf{425}.


% \Ingredient{361 grams flour}
\Ingredient{\flour{all-purpose}{5}{2}}
\Ingredient{1 teaspoon salt}
\Ingredient{1 teaspoon baking powder}
\Ingredient{1 tablespoon sugar}
Mix together the dry ingredients.

\Ingredient{6 tablespoons (85g) butter}
With two knives, a pastry blender, or your fingertips, cut or rub the butter in until the mixture looks like bread crumbs.

\Ingredient{1 cup (227g) milk}
Whole milk is the best kind of milk to make tender biscuits. Half \& half or light cream can also be used.
Add the milk all at once, mixing quickly and gently for about 20 seconds until you have a soft dough.

Pat the dough into a rectangle about 3/4'' thick. Fold it into thirds like a letter and roll gently with a floured rolling pin until the dough is 3/4'' thick again.

Cut into circles with a biscuit cutter for traditional round biscuits. Or, to avoid leftover dough scraps, cut the dough into squares or diamonds with a bench knife or scraper.
Place the biscuits on a pan close together (\fr14'' space) to help them rise higher and straighter as they hold each other as they rise.

Bake the biscuits for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're lightly browned. Remove them from the oven, and serve warm.
