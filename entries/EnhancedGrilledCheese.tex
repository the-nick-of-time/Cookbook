\Ingredient{2 tablespoons butter}
\Ingredient{2 cloves garlic, flattened}
\Ingredient{\fr14 teaspoon red pepper flakes}
\Ingredient{\fr14 teaspoon rubbed sage}
Melt the butter in a pan on low heat, alongside the seasonings.
Stir them together a bit, and give it a few minutes, to ensure that the flavors suffuse the butter.

\Ingredient{2 bread slices}
\Ingredient{honey mustard or dijon mustard}
\Ingredient{50 grams Cheddar cheese, sliced}
\Ingredient{50 grams Gruy\'ere cheese, sliced}
Turn up the stove to medium.
Spread the mustard on one side of one of the bread slices.
Assemble the sandwich with the mustard facing inwards.
This is usually easier when you put one of the breads in the pan then stack the cheese on.
Cook until melty and toasty.
