\Ingredient{\flour{\ap}{2}}
\Ingredient{1 tablespoon baking powder}  % Original calls for 2 tablespoons, that seems excessive so maybe they're using weak baking powder
\Ingredient{1 tablespoon sugar}
\Ingredient{1 teaspoon salt}
Whisk together.

Preheat oven to 425\0F.

\Ingredient{5 tablespoons butter, refrigerator temperature}
Cut into the dry ingredients, down to pea-sized pieces.

\Ingredient{1 cup whole milk + 1 teaspoon white vinegar OR 1 cup buttermilk}
Mix in almost all the buttermilk, until dough comes together when pinched.
In our dry climate it'll probably take adding the rest in too.
Take out onto a floured surface and use your hands to combine.
Pat into a flat rectangle about \fr12 inch thick.
Fold into thirds and roll to \fr12 inch again.
Cut into circles or triangles.

\Ingredient{butter, melted}
Place biscuits close together on a sheet pan and brush with melted butter.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden.
