\begin{recipe}[MashedPotatoesInstantPot]{Mashed Potatoes (Instant Pot)}{6 servings}{10 minutes prep, 30 minutes cooking}

	\Ingredient{6 medium potatoes}
	\Ingredient{2 cups water}
	\Ingredient{1 teaspoon salt}
	Peel and wash the potatoes.
	Put in the pressure cooker along with the water and put the salt on top of the potatoes (not directly in the water, that will discolor the metal).
	Cook on high pressure for 18 minutes.

	\Ingredient{1 cup milk}
	\Ingredient{4 tablespoons butter}
	Melt butter in milk. Mash the potatoes to small bits, then add milk and butter. Finish mashing.
	The order is important. It's really hard to get mashing started after you add the milk.
