\begin{recipe}{Salami Three Cheese Stromboli}{3 servings}{90 minutes prep, 30 minutes cooking}

Make pizza dough with the recipe on page \pageref{PizzaDough}.
It gives you two halves. Stretch and roll one half to make a rectangle shape, to fit in a 10"\X15" sheet pan.

\Ingredient{Pizza sauce (see page \pageref{PizzaSauce})}
\Ingredient{\fr12 cup cheddar, shredded}
\Ingredient{\fr14 cup parmesan, shredded}
\Ingredient{\fr34 cup mozzarella, shredded}
\Ingredient{A good amount of salami or pepperoni slices}
Preheat oven to 500 degrees with a sheet pan or pizza stone inside while it preheats.
Spread sauce all over the dough, leaving an inch border dry. Sprinkle Cheddar, Parmesan, mozzarella cheese, and make three rows of salami or pepperoni. Sprinkle a little more cheese on top of that.
Extra recommendations: chopped garlic and onion, chopped bell pepper, or whatever else you normally put on pizza. I would be more cautious with more liquidy toppings like fresh tomato, but as long as you make the slits in the top it should be fine.

\Ingredient{1 egg}
\Ingredient{1 tablespoon water}
\Ingredient{1 teaspoon oregano}
\Ingredient{1 teaspoon thyme}
\Ingredient{\fr12 teaspoon garlic powder}
Brush edges of dough with a little egg wash (single egg mixed with tablespoon of water) and roll dough lengthwise into a log, seam side down.
Egg wash the log, sprinkle with herbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, and cut 5 diagonal slits across the log to allow steam to release.
Remove hot sheet pan from oven, place Stromboli on parchment then lift it onto the pan and put it in the oven. Drop temperature to 400 immediately and cook for about 30 minutes. The top should be golden and bubbly.
