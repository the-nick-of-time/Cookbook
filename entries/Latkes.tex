%https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015533-classic-potato-latkes

\Ingredient{1 pound potatoes (about 2 large ones)}
\Ingredient{1 onion}
Grate using a food processor. Squeeze most of the liquid out by wrapping in a towel and wringing, or whatever other method is convenient.
Mincing the onion instead works better if you don't have a food processor. This way they don't express as much liquid and don't really need to be squeezed.
Transfer to a large bowl.

\Ingredient{2 large eggs}
\Ingredient{\fr12 cup \ap}
\Ingredient{2 teaspoons kosher salt}
\Ingredient{1 teaspoon baking powder}
\Ingredient{\fr12 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper}
Working quickly, add to the potato and onion. Mix until the flour is absorbed.

\Ingredient{Oil for frying}
Heat about \fr14 inch of oil in a large pan. Once hot, use a large tablespoon to drop the batter into the hot pan. Flatten into disks in the pan and cook for about 5 minutes per side, until brown and crispy.
