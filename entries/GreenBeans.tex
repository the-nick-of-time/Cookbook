\begin{recipe}[GreenBeans]{Green Beans}{1 serving}{10 minutes}

  \Ingredient{A handful of green beans}
  Break off the ends and any bad parts of the beans.
  Steam for a few minutes until done. They should be forkable but with a bit of crispness left, and fully green still with a bit of translucency. Yellowness is a sign of overcooking.

\end{recipe}
