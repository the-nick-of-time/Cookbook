\begin{recipe}{Baked Apples}{2 servings}{20 minutes prep, 15 minutes baking}

	Preheat the oven to \tempf{350}.

	\Ingredient{2 medium-sized apples}
	Cut the apples in half then remove the core, leaving a depression in the middle of each apple.

	\Ingredient{4 tablespoons brown sugar}
	\Ingredient{1 teaspoon cinnamon}
	\Ingredient{\fr12 teaspoon nutmeg}
	Pack the depression with a mix of the sugar and spices. You can mix them all together, or just top the apples with the spice; it makes little difference. Be sure to have the depressions full of sugar.

	\Ingredient{1 tablespoon butter, in 4 pieces}
	Place a very small pat of butter on top of each pile of sugar. It will melt into the sugar and help combine the flavors.

	Bake for 15 minutes or until apples are soft enough to eat with a spoon.
