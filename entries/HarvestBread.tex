Work into the dough.
Cover and let the dough rest at room temperature overnight, at least 8 hours.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form it into a round loaf.
Place the dough into a lightly greased bowl, smooth side up.
Cover once again and let rise at room temperature for about 2 hours, until puffy and not quite doubled in size.
Preheat oven to \tempf{425}.
Put a pan with \fr12 inch of hot water on the bottom rack of the oven and close the door.
Using a sharp knife slash the top of the bread in a crosshatch pattern.
Put the bread in the oven for 15 minutes.

Reduce the oven's temperature to \tempf{375} and bake for another 35 to 40 minutes, until the bread is deep brown in color and a thermometer in the center registers about \tempf{205}.

Remove onto a cooling rack and let cool completely before slicing.
