\Ingredient{3 cups sugar}
\Ingredient{\fr34 cup fresh lemon juice}

Immediately place filled, sealed jars on canner rack in hot water. Cover by at least 2 inches of water. Cover top, return water to boil, and process for 15 minutes. %10 minutes + 1 minute/1000 feet altitude
Lift jars out of water with tongs and space on towel to cool and dry.
