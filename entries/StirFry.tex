\begin{recipe}{Stir Fry}{4 servings}{1 hour marinating, 30 minutes cooking}

\Ingredient{1 pound of chicken thighs or breasts, cubed}
\Ingredient{\fr13 cup teriyaki/Yoshi sauce}
Marinate the chicken for at least an hour. If you are rushed, this step is fine to skip, just add the sauce during cooking.

\Ingredient{2 cups rice}
Prepare rice as on page \pageref{Rice}.

\Ingredient{1 medium onion, diced}
\Ingredient{2 medium carrots, diced}
\Ingredient{Several broccoli stems, diced}
\Ingredient{Several handfuls of snap peas or snow peas (in shells)}
\Ingredient{Several broccoli florets}
\Ingredient{Vegetable oil}
Cut up all the vegetables and keep separate. Heat a skillet with some oil in the bottom on medium-high. When hot, start adding the vegetables. Onion is first, carrots and broccoli a little later, chicken a few minutes after that, and peas and broccoli florets go on a few minutes before serving.
Serve over rice.
