\begin{recipe}{Basic Pasta Dough}{1 meal}{30 minutes prep, 20 minutes resting}

\Ingredient{3 large eggs}
\Ingredient{\flour{all-purpose}{9}{4}}
\Ingredient{\fr12 teaspoon water (if needed)}
Pour the flour into a mound. Make a well in the center. Break the eggs into the center of the well.
With a fork, beat the eggs to combine white and yolk. Using the fork, gradually incorporate flour into the eggs.
When you can't take more flour without breaking the dam, use your hands to swiftly combine the dough and contain the egg.
Begin working the dough with your hands until all the egg is worked in.
You might need a little water to fully incorporate the flour, at least in dry climates; the dough should be moist but not sticky.

\newstep
Wrap dough tightly in plastic. Wash excess dough off your hands and clean the work surface. Knead the dough until the dough is uniform and very smooth. Wrap again and let sit for 20 minutes before rolling it out.
