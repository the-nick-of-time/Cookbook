\begin{recipe}{Hamburger Pasties}{6 servings}{30+25 minutes prep, 30 minutes baking split over two days}

This recipe can be split over two days: preparing the filling and the crust in the evening, then assembling and baking the following morning. The components do not need to cool overnight, but if not at least allocate 20 minutes for it to cool.

\Ingredient{1 pound ground beef}
\Ingredient{2 medium potatoes}
\Ingredient{1 onion}
\Ingredient{2 full-sized carrots}
\Ingredient{5 cloves garlic}
\Ingredient{1 teaspoon paprika}
\Ingredient{\fr18 teaspoon ground mustard}
Chop and cook together until all components are fully cooked. Set aside and cool.

\newstep
Prepare a pie crust like the one found on page \pageref{PieCrust}. Beware that this can take a while; however it may give the filling enough time to cool if you are doing this all at once.

\newstep
Preheat the oven to 375\0F.
Divide the pie dough into sixths and roll each into a circle. Spoon the filling onto each crust, fold over, and seal. Bake for 20-25 minutes.
